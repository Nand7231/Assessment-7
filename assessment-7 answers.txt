i think this come down to BIG O where different functions contain different amount of resources to complete each function depending on the size of different arrays and such. 

for example the inster function runs on a exponential scale. meaning the bigger the array the functions exponentially increase. where as the append function runs on a linear scale. where the functions linearly increase. 


the second functions scales better in my oppinion because the timings are consistently lower than the other.
